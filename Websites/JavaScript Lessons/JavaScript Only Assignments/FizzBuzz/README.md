Problem Situation - Answer FizzBuzz, a popular interview question
- Input: single number
- Logic Of Situation (needs to be figured out in an interview question using Test Cases, good place to start the lesson)
  - Divisible be by 3 = Fizz
  - Divisible by 5 = Buzz
  - Divisible by both 3 & 5 = FizzBuzz
  - Not Divisible by 3 or 5 = Input
  - Not a number = "Not a Number", may need to explain Not a Number
- CAUTION: the order of this logic is out of order, considering the code

Output to the Console: concatenation to describe Boolean
- Fizz
- Buzz
- FizzBuzz
- "This test number does nothing important."
- "This test number is actually not a number."
