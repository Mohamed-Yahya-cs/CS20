# Operators, Progress, and Notes
Introduction to Operators and Computational Thinking

## Ideas to Include
Two primitive variables
Initialize an array instead
Create Primitive Variables to illustrate simple operations, console.log these
Then create a function to summarize this.
Create a skipCount FOR Loop
- by 2, from 0
- by 3's, starting at 15, backwards
- by x3's, starting at 15, forwards

To Do
- Create a skipCounting Function, must also choose proper parameters and arguments
- Modulus: even or odd
- Simple Comparisons, include simple Operator until IF Statement evaluates to true
- Ternary Operator: Gold-Silver
- Falsy: default and user-initiated
- Biswise Example: read, write, execute permissions
