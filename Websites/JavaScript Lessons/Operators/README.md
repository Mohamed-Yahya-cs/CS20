# Operators, Progress, and Notes
Introduction to Operators and Computational Thinking

## Ideas to Include
Two primitive variables

Initialize an array instead

Create Primitive Variables to illustrate simple operations, console.log these

Then create a function to summarize this.

Create a skipCount FOR Loop
- by 2, from 0 (Arithmetic Sequence, Linear Function)
- by 3's, starting at 15, backwards (Arithmetic Sequence, Linear Function)
- by x4's, starting at 15, forwards (Geometric Sequence, Linear Function)

Review: FOR Loop and variables in terms of actual arithmetic sequences
- Create a sentence that uses the parameters to mimic the arithmetic sequence, described by the arguments
- Write the sentence as a comment & instructions for the function

To Do
- Create a skipCounting Function, must also choose proper parameters and arguments
- Modulus: even or odd
- Simple Comparisons, include simple Operator until IF Statement evaluates to true
- Ternary Operator: Gold-Silver
- Falsy: default and user-initiated
- Biswise Example: read, write, execute permissions
