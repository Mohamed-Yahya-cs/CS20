# HTML Form and JavaScript Interactions
Verifying Data and Executing JavaScript Through Functions

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

**Purpose**: to create a multiple page website
- A main page will link to all working assignments
- Each child page will have text inputs and radio or checkboxes for test cases (mathematical boundaries to empirically test the data)


CONTINUE with LandScape
- JavaScript files
- Stepping through setting up the code and the links
- use CODE in ReadMe.md

Steps in Creating an HTML Form (Input & Output) using JavaScript to Processes Information
- Copy the <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/CS20/tree/master/Websites/Intermediate%20Boilerplate/Basic%20Form%20Collection">HTML Form Boilerplate example</a>
  - In this repository, this will be the child_pages/childTemplate.html
  - This template should be all the layout needed for the majority of all the pages
  - Note: in other pages use the parts needed, changing coding, and delete other parts
-

Steps in Adding this form to a multiple page website (the example given in this pathway)
- Change the index.html to have navigation to Child Pages, Navigation Menu
  - Remember: pathway due to folders
- Change each Child Page to have navigation to the Script Pages
  - Remember: pathway due to folders here is different (..)
  - Note: open the /child_pages/childTemplate.html and look in the console
  - Return: "I made it" from scripts/childTemplate.js (for debugging the script link)
- Copy a childTemplage.html doc and rename to a new doc.html
  - Do the same for childTemplate.js

# Ideas to Include

How this form will be used in the JavaScript Lessons
- Text inputs will record Variables for the Individual Assignments
- Radio Buttons or Checkboxes will test the Case Study Values
