# Modulus Assignments
Description of Assignment

**Under Construction**

Situation: Return even and then odd numbers to a specific number

Simple Expectations
- Begin with two hardcoded variables (hard coded variables simulates user initiated content)
- Return the odd numbers between these two variables
- Return even numbers between two hardcoded variables
- Concatenate the answers to know which is which when these are printed out

Intermediate Expectations
- Return the amount of odd numbers
- Return the amount of even numbers
- Concatenate the answers to know which is which when these are printed out

Modulus Assignment Expectations
- Create a program that skip counts through a sequence of 20 numbers
- For each even number, save it into an evenArray
- For each odd number, save it into an oddArray
- Output to the console ...
  1. The entire sequence of numbers
  2. All the numbers in the sequence that are even
  3. All the numbers in the sequence that are odd
